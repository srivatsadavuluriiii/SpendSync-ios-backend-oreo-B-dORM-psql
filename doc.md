# SpendSync Backend Implementation Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the work we've done so far on the SpendSync expense-splitting application backend.

## Project Overview

SpendSync is a microservices-based application designed to help users track group expenses and handle settlements efficiently. The architecture consists of 5 microservices that work together to provide the complete functionality.

## Implemented Services

### 1. API Gateway (Port 3000)

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices.

**Implemented Features:**
- Express.js server setup with necessary middleware
- Authentication middleware with demo bypass mode for development
- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- Service proxying with appropriate path handling for each service
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Interactive API documentation using Swagger UI
- User-friendly HTML dashboards for each service
- CORS configuration and security headers
- Error handling and standardized error responses
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

**Key Files:**
- `src/api-gateway/index.js`: Main entry point with server setup
- `src/api-gateway/routes.js`: API route definitions
- `src/api-gateway/middleware/auth.middleware.js`: Authentication middleware
- `src/api-gateway/utils/service-proxy.js`: Utility for proxying requests to microservices
- `src/api-gateway/swagger.json`: API documentation

### 2. User Service (Port 3001)

The User Service manages user accounts and authentication.

**Implemented Features:**
- Express.js server setup
- Basic user CRUD operations
- Group management APIs
- Mock authentication for development
- Health check endpoint

**Key Files:**
- `src/services/user-service/index.ts`: Main entry point
- `src/services/user-service/routes/user.routes.ts`: User API routes
- `src/services/user-service/controllers/user.controller.ts`: User request handlers
- `src/services/user-service/models/user.model.ts`: User data model

### 3. Expense Service (Port 3002)

The Expense Service handles expense tracking and splitting.

**Implemented Features:**
- Express.js server setup
- Expense CRUD operations
- Expense splitting among participants
- Health check endpoint

**Key Files:**
- `src/services/expense-service/index.ts`: Main entry point
- `src/services/expense-service/routes/expense.routes.ts`: Expense API routes
- `src/services/expense-service/controllers/expense.controller.ts`: Expense request handlers
- `src/services/expense-service/models/expense.model.ts`: Expense data model

### 4. Settlement Service (Port 3003)

The Settlement Service calculates and manages settlements between users.

**Implemented Features:**
- Express.js server setup
- Greedy algorithm implementation for optimizing settlements
- Settlement CRUD operations
- Settlement calculation API
- Health check endpoint

**Key Files:**
- `src/services/settlement-service/index.ts`: Main entry point
- `src/services/settlement-service/routes/settlement.routes.ts`: Settlement API routes
- `src/services/settlement-service/controllers/settlement.controller.ts`: Settlement request handlers
- `src/services/settlement-service/algorithms/greedy.algorithm.ts`: Settlement optimization algorithm
- `src/services/settlement-service/models/settlement.model.ts`: Settlement data model

### 5. Notification Service (Port 3004)

The Notification Service handles user notifications.

**Implemented Features:**
- Express.js server setup
- Notification CRUD operations
- Notification delivery tracking
- Health check endpoint

**Key Files:**
- `src/services/notification-service/index.ts`: Main entry point
- `src/services/notification-service/routes/notification.routes.ts`: Notification API routes
- `src/services/notification-service/controllers/notification.controller.ts`: Notification request handlers
- `src/services/notification-service/models/notification.model.ts`: Notification data model

## Technical Implementations

### TypeScript Migration

We've migrated several key JavaScript files to TypeScript to improve code quality and developer experience:

- Converted `index.js` to TypeScript in all services
- Implemented TypeScript interfaces for data models
- Added type safety to API controllers and services
- Created TypeScript implementation of the greedy algorithm

### Mock Services

To facilitate development and testing, we've implemented mock versions of several services:

- Mock Redis client for job queue processing
- Mock monitoring service for performance tracking
- Mock authentication for bypassing security during development

### Service Communication

We've implemented a robust service communication mechanism:

- RESTful API-based communication between services
- Proper request forwarding from API Gateway to microservices
- Handling of different resource paths based on service requirements
- Error handling during inter-service communication

### User Interfaces

We've created simple but effective browser-based dashboards:

- Main dashboard in the API Gateway with links to service UIs
- Service-specific dashboards that fetch and display data in a tabular format
- Real-time data fetching from respective API endpoints
- Error handling and user-friendly display

## Startup and Deployment

### Services Launcher

We've created a shell script `start-services.sh` that allows running all microservices simultaneously:

- Launches each service in the background
- Sets proper environment variables
- Shows real-time logs from all services

### Documentation

We've created comprehensive documentation:

- `README.md` with project overview and setup instructions
- API documentation using Swagger
- Service-specific documentation
- Implementation details and architecture explanation

## Challenges Addressed

During development, we addressed several challenges:

1. **TypeScript Conversion**: Fixed TypeScript errors during conversion from JavaScript
2. **Module Not Found Errors**: Resolved "Cannot find module" errors for various imports
3. **Routing Issues**: Fixed "Route.get() requires a callback function" errors in the Settlement Service
4. **Authentication Problems**: Implemented a development bypass for authentication to simplify testing
5. **Service Proxying**: Corrected path handling in the API Gateway to properly route requests to microservices

## Next Steps

While we've made significant progress, some potential next steps include:

1. Implementing persistent data storage with MongoDB
2. Adding unit and integration tests for all services
3. Implementing production-ready authentication
4. Adding more sophisticated settlement algorithms
5. Creating client applications to consume the APIs
6. Implementing real-time notifications using WebSockets
7. Adding payment integration for settling debts
8. Implementing proper logging and monitoring
