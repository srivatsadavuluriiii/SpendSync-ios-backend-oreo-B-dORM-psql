# API Versioning Implementation - Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the API versioning implementation for the SpendSync settlement service. The solution provides a flexible and future-proof approach to API versioning that maintains backward compatibility while allowing the API to evolve.

## Files Created or Modified

### Core Versioning Infrastructure
1. `src/middleware/versioning.middleware.js` - Core versioning middleware
   - Extracts API version from request (path, headers)
   - Validates version against supported versions
   - Provides version routing functionality

2. `src/utils/version.utils.js` - Versioning utilities
   - Helper functions for working with versioned controllers
   - Automatic discovery of versioned controller files

3. `src/routes/api.routes.js` - Main API router
   - Central point for organizing and versioning all API routes
   - Maps both versioned and non-versioned routes

### Application Files
4. `src/index.js` - Main application file (modified)
   - Updated to use versioned API router
   - Added API versions to health check endpoint

5. `src/config/swagger.js` - Swagger configuration (modified)
   - Updated to include versioning information in API docs

6. `src/routes/settlement.routes.js` - Example route file (modified)
   - Updated to demonstrate versioned route handling

7. `src/routes/export.routes.js` - Export route file (modified)
   - Updated to use versioned route handling

8. `src/controllers/settlement.controller.v2.js` - Example v2 controller
   - Demonstrates how to create a new controller version

### Documentation & Testing
9. `docs/API_VERSIONING.md` - Detailed documentation
   - Comprehensive guide to the versioning approach

10. `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - API version changelog
    - Tracks changes across API versions

11. `README-API-VERSIONING.md` - Quick start guide
    - Getting started with the versioning system

12. `scripts/test-versioning.js` - Versioning test script
    - Tests different version specification methods

13. `package.json` - Package file (modified)
    - Added script for running versioning tests

## Features of the Versioning System

### Multiple Version Specification Methods
- **URL Path**: `/api/v1/settlements`
- **Accept Header**: `Accept: application/vnd.spendsync.v1+json`
- **Custom Header**: `X-API-Version: v1`

### Flexible Version Handling
- Automatic controller discovery based on filename pattern
- Only need to implement methods that change in new versions
- Versioning at the individual endpoint level

### Backward Compatibility
- Non-versioned routes map to the latest stable version
- Clear version information in response headers

### Developer Experience
- Utilities to simplify working with versions
- Comprehensive documentation
- Testing tools

## Next Steps for Using the Versioning System

1. Continue developing with `v1` as the current version
2. When breaking changes are needed:
   - Add the version to `SUPPORTED_VERSIONS` in `versioning.middleware.js`
   - Create new controller files with `.v2.js` suffix
   - Implement only the methods that change
   - Update documentation to reflect changes

3. Test new API versions thoroughly before release
4. Communicate version changes to API consumers

## API Versioning Best Practices

1. Make breaking changes only when necessary
2. Document all changes between versions
3. Maintain backward compatibility 
4. Provide a deprecation schedule for old versions
5. Use semantic versioning for API versions
